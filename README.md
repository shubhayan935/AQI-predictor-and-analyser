# AQI-predictor-and-analyser
Machine Learning approach to determining which factor affects the AQI of an area the most.

When asked on how to improve the Air Quality Index of a given area, authorities may just say ,"Reduce number of cars." However, it is possible that the pollutant causing the bad AQI of an area is one that is not produced by cars, or is only produced in small quantities, like say Ozone. Here, I have used Machine Learning to determine which factor affects the AQI of different areas in Mumbai the most.
